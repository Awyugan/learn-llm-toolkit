# 吴恩达：如何成为创新者
为有抱负的创新者提供关于人工智能的尝试、失败和未来的建议。


This essay is part of MIT Technology Review’s 2023 Innovators Under 35 package.
本文是《麻省理工学院技术评论》2023 年 35 岁以下创新者计划的一部分。

Innovation is a powerful engine for uplifting society and fueling economic growth. Antibiotics, electric lights, refrigerators, airplanes, smartphones—we have these things because innovators created something that didn’t exist before. MIT Technology Review’s Innovators Under 35 list celebrates individuals who have accomplished a lot early in their careers and are likely to accomplish much more still. 
创新是提升社会水平、推动经济增长的强大引擎。抗生素、电灯、冰箱、飞机、智能手机——我们拥有这些东西是因为创新者创造了以前不存在的东西。 《麻省理工科技评论》的 35 岁以下创新者名单表彰了那些在职业生涯早期取得了巨大成就并且可能取得更多成就的个人。

Having spent many years working on AI research and building AI products, I’m fortunate to have participated in a few innovations that made an impact, like using reinforcement learning to fly helicopter drones at Stanford, starting and leading Google Brain to drive large-scale deep learning, and creating online courses that led to the founding of Coursera. I’d like to share some thoughts about how to do it well, sidestep some of the pitfalls, and avoid building things that lead to serious harm along the way.
我花了多年时间从事人工智能研究和构建人工智能产品，我很幸运能够参与一些产生影响的创新，比如在斯坦福大学使用强化学习来驾驶直升机无人机、启动并领导谷歌大脑推动大规模应用深度学习以及创建在线课程，最终促成了 Coursera 的成立。我想分享一些关于如何做好这件事、避开一些陷阱以及避免构建会导致严重伤害的想法。

### AI is a dominant driver of innovation today 人工智能是当今创新的主要驱动力

As I have said before, I believe AI is the new electricity. Electricity revolutionized all industries and changed our way of life, and AI is doing the same. It’s reaching into every industry and discipline, and it’s yielding advances that help multitudes of people.
正如我之前所说，我相信人工智能是新电力。电力彻底改变了所有行业并改变了我们的生活方式，人工智能也在做同样的事情。它正在渗透到每一个行业和学科，并且所取得的进步可以帮助许多人。

AI—like electricity—is a general-­purpose technology. Many innovations, such as a medical treatment, space rocket, or battery design, are fit for one purpose. In contrast, AI is useful for generating art, serving web pages that are relevant to a search query, optimizing shipping routes to save fuel, helping cars avoid collisions, and much more. 
人工智能就像电力一样，是一种通用技术。许多创新，例如医疗、太空火箭或电池设计，都适合某一目的。相比之下，人工智能可用于创作艺术、提供与搜索查询相关的网页、优化运输路线以节省燃料、帮助汽车避免碰撞等等。

The advance of AI creates opportunities for everyone in all corners of the economy to explore whether or how it applies to their area. Thus, learning about AI creates disproportionately many opportunities to do something that no one else has ever done before.
人工智能的进步为经济各个领域的每个人创造了机会，探索人工智能是否或如何应用于他们的领域。因此，学习人工智能创造了更多的机会去做别人从未做过的事情。

For instance, at AI Fund, a venture studio that I lead, I’ve been privileged to participate in projects that apply AI to maritime shipping, relationship coaching, talent management, education, and other areas. Because many AI technologies are new, their application to most domains has not yet been explored. In this way, knowing how to take advantage of AI gives you numerous opportunities to collaborate with others. 
例如，在我领导的风险投资工作室 AI Fund，我有幸参与了将人工智能应用于海运、关系辅导、人才管理、教育和其他领域的项目。由于许多人工智能技术都是新技术，因此尚未探索它们在大多数领域的应用。通过这种方式，了解如何利用人工智能可以为您提供大量与他人合作的机会。

Looking ahead, a few developments are especially exciting.
展望未来，一些进展尤其令人兴奋。

- Prompting: While ChatGPT has popularized the ability to prompt an AI model to write, say, an email or a poem, software developers are just beginning to understand that prompting enables them to build in minutes the types of powerful AI applications that used to take months. A massive wave of AI applications will be built this way. 
提示：虽然 ChatGPT 已经普及了提示 AI 模型写一封电子邮件或一首诗的功能，但软件开发人员才刚刚开始认识到，提示使他们能够在几分钟内构建出过去需要几个月才能构建的强大 AI 应用程序类型。大量的人工智能应用将通过这种方式构建。

- Vision transformers: Text trans­formers—language models based on the transformer neural network architecture, which was invented in 2017 by Google Brain and collaborators—have revolutionized writing. Vision transformers, which adapt transformers to computer vision tasks such as recognizing objects in images, were introduced in 2020 and quickly gained widespread attention. The buzz around vision transformers in the technical community today reminds me of the buzz around text transformers a couple of years before ChatGPT. A similar revolution is coming to image processing. Visual prompting, in which the prompt is an image rather than a string of text, will be part of this change.
视觉变压器：文本变压器——基于变压器神经网络架构的语言模型，由 Google Brain 及其合作者于 2017 年发明——彻底改变了写作。视觉变压器于 2020 年推出，使变压器能够适应计算机视觉任务，例如识别图像中的物体，并迅速获得了广泛关注。今天技术社区中关于视觉转换器的讨论让我想起了 ChatGPT 出现前几年关于文本转换器的讨论。图像处理领域也即将迎来一场类似的革命。视觉提示（其中提示是图像而不是文本字符串）将是此更改的一部分。

- AI applications: The press has given a lot of attention to AI’s hardware and software infrastructure and developer tools. But this emerging AI infrastructure won’t succeed unless even more valuable AI businesses are built on top of it. So even though a lot of media attention is on the AI infrastructure layer, there will be even more growth in the AI application layer. 
人工智能应用：媒体对人工智能的硬件和软件基础设施以及开发工具给予了很多关注。但除非在其之上建立更有价值的人工智能业务，否则这种新兴的人工智能基础设施不会成功。因此，尽管媒体的大量关注集中在人工智能基础设施层，但人工智能应用层将会有更多的增长。

These areas offer rich opportunities for innovators. Moreover, many of them are within reach of broadly tech-savvy people, not just people already in AI. Online courses, open-source software, software as a service, and online research papers give everyone tools to learn and start innovating. But even if these technologies aren’t yet within your grasp, many other paths to innovation are wide open.
这些领域为创新者提供了丰富的机会。此外，其中许多技术都是精通技术的人可以接触到的，而不仅仅是已经从事人工智能领域的人。在线课程、开源软件、软件即服务和在线研究论文为每个人提供了学习和开始创新的工具。但即使这些技术尚不属于您的掌握范围，许多其他创新途径也是敞开的。

### Be optimistic, but dare to fail  乐观，但敢于失败

That said, a lot of ideas that initially seem promising turn out to be duds. Duds are unavoidable if you take innovation seriously. Here are some projects of mine that you probably haven’t heard of, because they were duds: 
也就是说，许多最初看似有希望的想法最终证明是无用的。如果你认真对待创新，失败是不可避免的。以下是我的一些项目，你可能没有听说过，因为它们很糟糕：

- I spent a long time trying to get aircraft to fly autonomously in formation to save fuel (similar to birds that fly in a V formation). In hindsight, I executed poorly and should have worked with much larger aircraft.
  我花了很长时间试图让飞机自动编队飞行以节省燃料（类似于以 V 形编队飞行的鸟类）。事后看来，我的表现很差，应该使用更大的飞机。
- I tried to get a robot arm to unload dishwashers that held dishes of all different shapes and sizes. In hindsight, I was much too early. Deep-learning algorithms for perception and control weren’t good enough at the time. 
  我试图用机器人手臂来卸载装有各种不同形状和大小的盘子的洗碗机。事后看来，我来得太早了。当时用于感知和控制的深度学习算法还不够好。
- About 15 years ago, I thought that unsupervised learning (that is, enabling machine-learning models to learn from unlabeled data) was a promising approach. I mistimed this idea as well. It’s finally working, though, as the availability of data and computational power has grown.
  大约 15 年前，我认为无监督学习（即使机器学习模型能够从未标记的数据中学习）是一种很有前途的方法。我也错误地提出了这个想法。不过，随着数据可用性和计算能力的增长，它终于开始发挥作用了。

It was painful when these projects didn’t succeed, but the lessons I learned turned out to be instrumental for other projects that fared better. Through my failed attempt at V-shape flying, I learned to plan projects much better and front-load risks. The effort to unload dishwashers failed, but it led my team to build the Robot Operating System (ROS), which became a popular open-source framework that’s now in robots from self-driving cars to mechanical dogs. Even though my initial focus on unsupervised learning was a poor choice, the steps we took turned out to be critical in scaling up deep learning at Google Brain.
当这些项目没有成功时，我感到很痛苦，但我学到的经验教训对其他表现更好的项目很有帮助。通过 V 形飞行的失败尝试，我学会了更好地规划项目并预先承担风险。卸载洗碗机的努力失败了，但它引导我的团队构建了机器人操作系统（ROS），它成为一个流行的开源框架，现在应用于从自动驾驶汽车到机械狗的机器人中。尽管我最初关注无监督学习是一个糟糕的选择，但事实证明我们采取的步骤对于扩大 Google Brain 的深度学习至关重要。

> Society has a deep interest in the fruits of innovation. And that is a good reason to approach innovation with optimism.
> 社会对创新成果有着浓厚的兴趣。这是乐观地对待创新的一个很好的理由。

Innovation has never been easy. When you do something new, there will be skeptics. In my younger days, I faced a lot of skepticism when starting most of the projects that ultimately proved to be successful. But this is not to say the skeptics are always wrong. I faced skepticism for most of the unsuccessful projects as well.
创新从来都不是一件容易的事。当你做一些新的事情时，就会有人怀疑。在我年轻的时候，当我开始大多数最终被证明是成功的项目时，我都面临着很多怀疑。但这并不是说怀疑论者总是错误的。对于大多数不成功的项目，我也面临着怀疑。

As I became more experienced, I found that more and more people would agree with whatever I said, and that was even more worrying. I had to actively seek out people who would challenge me and tell me the truth. Luckily, these days I am surrounded by people who will tell me when they think I’m doing something dumb! 
随着我经验的积累，我发现越来越多的人会同意我所说的，这就更让人担心了。我必须积极寻找那些愿意挑战我并告诉我真相的人。幸运的是，这些天我周围的人都会告诉我，当他们认为我做了一些愚蠢的事情时！

While skepticism is healthy and even necessary, society has a deep interest in the fruits of innovation. And that is a good reason to approach innovation with optimism. I’d rather side with the optimist who wants to give it a shot and might fail than the pessimist who doubts what’s possible. 
虽然怀疑是健康的，甚至是必要的，但社会对创新成果有着浓厚的兴趣。这是乐观地对待创新的一个很好的理由。我宁愿支持那些想要尝试但可能会失败的乐观主义者，也不愿支持那些怀疑可能性的悲观主义者。

### Take responsibility for your work 对你的工作负责

As we focus on AI as a driver of valuable innovation throughout society, social responsibility is more important than ever. People both inside and outside the field see a wide range of possible harms AI may cause. These include both short-term issues, such as bias and harmful applications of the technology, and long-term risks, such as concentration of power and potentially catastrophic applications. It’s important to have open and intellectually rigorous conversations about them. In that way, we can come to an agreement on what the real risks are and how to reduce them.
当我们专注于人工智能作为整个社会有价值创新的驱动力时，社会责任比以往任何时候都更加重要。领域内外的人们都看到人工智能可能造成的广泛危害。这些既包括短期问题，例如技术的偏见和有害应用，也包括长期风险，例如权力集中和潜在的灾难性应用。就这些问题进行公开且严谨的对话非常重要。这样，我们就可以就真正的风险是什么以及如何减少风险达成一致。

Over the past millennium, successive waves of innovation have reduced infant mortality, improved nutrition, boosted literacy, raised standards of living worldwide, and fostered civil rights including protections for women, minorities, and other marginalized groups. Yet innovations have also contributed to climate change, spurred rising inequality, polarized society, and increased loneliness. 
在过去的千年里，一波又一波的创新降低了婴儿死亡率，改善了营养，提高了识字率，提高了全世界的生活水平，并促进了公民权利，包括保护妇女、少数民族和其他边缘群体。然而，创新也导致了气候变化、不平等加剧、社会两极分化和孤独感加剧。

Clearly, the benefits of innovation come with risks, and we have not always managed them wisely. AI is the next wave, and we have an obligation to learn lessons from the past to maximize future benefits for everyone and minimize harm. This will require commitment from both individuals and society at large. 
显然，创新的好处伴随着风险，而我们并不总是明智地管理它们。人工智能是下一波浪潮，我们有义务吸取过去的教训，最大限度地为每个人未来带来利益，并最大限度地减少伤害。这需要个人和整个社会的承诺。

At the social level, [governments are moving to regulate AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/22/1073482/our-quick-guide-to-the-6-ways-we-can-regulate-ai/). To some innovators, regulation may look like an unnecessary restraint on progress. I see it differently. Regulation helps us avoid mistakes and enables new benefits as we move into an uncertain future. I welcome regulation that calls for more transparency into the opaque workings of large tech companies; this will help us understand their impact and steer them toward achieving broader societal benefits. Moreover, new regulations are needed because many existing ones were written for a pre-AI world. The new regulations should specify the outcomes we want in important areas like health care and finance—and those we do not want. 
在社会层面，各国政府正在着手监管人工智能。对于一些创新者来说，监管可能看起来像是对进步的不必要的限制。我有不同的看法。当我们进入不确定的未来时，监管可以帮助我们避免错误并带来新的好处。我欢迎要求提高大型科技公司不透明运作透明度的监管；这将帮助我们了解它们的影响并引导它们实现更广泛的社会效益。此外，需要新的法规，因为许多现有法规是为前人工智能时代制定的。新法规应明确我们在医疗保健和金融等重要领域想要的结果以及我们不想要的结果。

But avoiding harm shouldn’t be just a priority for society. It also needs to be a priority for each innovator. As technologists, we have a responsibility to understand the implications of our research and innovate in ways that are beneficial. Traditionally, many technologists adopted the attitude that the shape technology takes is inevitable and there’s nothing we can do about it, so we might as well innovate freely. But we know that’s not true. 
但避免伤害不应该只是社会的首要任务。它还需要成为每个创新者的优先事项。作为技术专家，我们有责任了解我们研究的影响并以有益的方式进行创新。传统上，许多技术专家的态度是，技术的发展是不可避免的，我们对此无能为力，所以我们不妨自由创新。但我们知道事实并非如此。

> Avoiding harm shouldn’t be just a priority for society. It also needs to be a priority for each innovator. 
> 避免伤害不应该只是社会的首要任务。它还需要成为每个创新者的优先事项。

When innovators choose to work on differential privacy (which allows AI to learn from data without exposing personally identifying information), they make a powerful statement that privacy matters. That statement helps shape the social norms adopted by public and private institutions. Conversely, when innovators create Web3 cryptographic protocols to launder money, that too creates a powerful statement—in my view, a harmful one—that governments should not be able to trace how funds are transferred and spent. 
当创新者选择致力于差异化隐私（允许人工智能从数据中学习而不暴露个人身份信息）时，他们就做出了强有力的声明：隐私很重要。该声明有助于塑造公共和私人机构采用的社会规范。相反，当创新者创建 Web3 加密协议来洗钱时，这也产生了一个强有力的声明——在我看来，这是一个有害的声明——政府不应该能够追踪资金是如何转移和花费的。

If you see something unethical being done, I hope you’ll raise it with your colleagues and supervisors and engage them in constructive conversations. And if you are asked to work on something that you don’t think helps humanity, I hope you’ll actively work to put a stop to it. If you are unable to do so, then consider walking away. At AI Fund, I have killed projects that I assessed to be financially sound but ethically unsound. I urge you to do the same. 
如果您发现有不道德的行为，我希望您向同事和主管提出，并与他们进行建设性对话。如果你被要求从事一些你认为对人类无益的事情，我希望你能积极努力阻止它。如果您无法这样做，请考虑走开。在人工智能基金，我已经取消了那些我认为财务上合理但道德上不健全的项目。我敦促你也这样做。

Now, go forth and innovate! If you’re already in the innovation game, keep at it. There’s no telling what great accomplishment lies in your future. If your ideas are in the daydream stage, share them with others and get help to shape them into something practical and successful. Start executing, and find ways to use the power of innovation for good. 
现在，勇往直前，勇于创新！如果您已经参与创新游戏，请坚持下去。没有人知道你的未来会取得什么伟大的成就。如果您的想法还处于白日梦阶段，请与他人分享并获得帮助，将其变成实用且成功的东西。开始执行，找到利用创新力量行善的方法。
